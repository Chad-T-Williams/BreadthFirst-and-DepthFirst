    "**Submission**: submit your Ipython notebook (the \\*.ipynb file) as well as  electronically on StudyNet before November 7, 9am. Rename this notebook to `<your_last_name_assignment_2>`. Then File > Download as > Notebook. *It is very important to give your file the correct name. Failure to do so is penalized with 2 marks.*\n",
